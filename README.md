## About
@ ChatGPT
Welcome to the electrifying WiFi Hacking Challenge, where participants test their prowess in network infiltration and compete for the grand prize: a cutting-edge Raspberry Pi! In this adrenaline-pumping competition, aspiring hackers will face a series of trials designed 
to assess their skills in various aspects of WiFi security. The first part of the challenge dives into cracking Pre-Shared Keys (PSKs) within the Extensible Authentication Protocol over LAN (EAPOL). Contestants will be tasked with exploiting vulnerabilities in wireless 
networks using an array of techniques, such as capturing handshakes, decrypting packets, and brute-forcing passwords. Armed with their trusty tools and unyielding determination, participants must showcase their exceptional abilities in this arena, striving to unravel the 
intricacies of PSKs in EAPOL. The stakes are high, and only the most skilled WiFi warriors will emerge victorious, earning the coveted Raspberry Pi and the admiration of their peers.
